// The function takes in 2 inputs x and y, and should return x to the power of y

// Simple, right? But you're NOT allowed to use Math.pow();

// Obs: x and y will be naturals, so DON'T take fractions into consideration;

// Note : zero to the power of zero equals one in this kata
function power(x, y) {
  return x ** y;
}

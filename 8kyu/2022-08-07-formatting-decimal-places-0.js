// Each number should be formatted that it is rounded to two decimal places. You don't need to check whether the input is a valid number because only valid numbers are used in the tests.

// Example:    
// 5.5589 is rounded 5.56   
// 3.3424 is rounded 3.34

const twoDecimalPlaces = n => +n.toFixed(2);

// Prolog:

// This kata series was created for friends of mine who just started to learn programming. Wish you all the best and keep your mind open and sharp!
// Task:

// Write a function that will accept two parameters: variable and type and check if type of variable is matching type. Return true if types match or false if not.
// Examples:

// 42, "number"   --> true
// "42", "number" --> false
function typeValidation(variable, type) {
  return typeof variable === type;
}

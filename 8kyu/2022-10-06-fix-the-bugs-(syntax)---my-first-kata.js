// Fix the Bugs (Syntax) - My First Kata
// Overview

// Hello, this is my first Kata so forgive me if it is of poor quality.

// In this Kata you should fix/create a program that returns the following values:

//     false/False if either a or b (or both) are not numbers
//     a % b plus b % a if both arguments are numbers

// You may assume the following:

//     If a and b are both numbers, neither of a or b will be 0.

// Language-Specific Instructions
// Javascript and PHP

// In this Kata you should try to fix all the syntax errors found in the code.

// Once you think all the bugs are fixed run the code to see if it works. A correct solution should return the values specified in the overview.

// Extension: Once you have fixed all the syntax errors present in the code (basic requirement), you may attempt to optimise the code or try a different approach by coding it from scratch.

const myFirstKata = (a, b) => a === +a && b === +b ? a % b + b % a : false;

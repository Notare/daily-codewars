// You are given a method called main, make it print the line Hello World!, (yes, that includes a new line character at the end) and don't return anything

// Note that for some languages, the function main is the entry point of the program.

// Here's how it will be tested:

//     Solution.main("parameter1","parameter2");

// Hints:

//     Check your references
//     Think about the scope of your method
//     For prolog you can use write but there are better ways
//     If you still don't get it probably you can define main as an attribute of the Solution class that accepts a single argument, and that only prints "Hello World!" without any return.
class Solution {
  static main() {
    console.log("Hello World!");
  }
}

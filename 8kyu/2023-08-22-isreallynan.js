// I've hit a few bugs in my Java/Type/Coffee-script code recently, and I've traced the problem back to the global isNaN function I was using. I had expected it to be more discerning, but it's returning true for undefined right now.

// Write a function isReallyNaN that returns true only if passed in an argument that evalutes to NaN, and returns false otherwise.

// Any solution is acceptable!
const isReallyNaN = (val) => {
  return Number.isNaN(val);
};

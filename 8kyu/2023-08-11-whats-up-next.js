// Given a sequence of items and a specific item in that sequence, return the item immediately following the item specified. If the item occurs more than once in a sequence, return the item after the first occurence. This should work for a sequence of any type.

// When the item isn't present or nothing follows it, the function should return nil in Clojure and Elixir, Nothing in Haskell, undefined in JavaScript, None in Python.

// nextItem([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 3) # 4
// nextItem("testing", "t") # "e"
function nextItem(xs, item) {
  var found = false;
  for (var x of xs) {
    if (found) return x;
    if (x == item) found = true;
  }
  return undefined;
}

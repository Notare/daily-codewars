// A western man is trying to find gold in a river. To do that, he passes a bucket through the river's soil and then checks if it contains any gold. However, he could be more productive if he wrote an algorithm to do the job for him.

// So, you need to check if there is gold in the bucket, and if so, return True/true. If not, return False/false.

function checkTheBucket(bucket) {
    return bucket.includes('gold');
}

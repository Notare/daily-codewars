// The aspect ratio of an image describes the proportional relationship between its width and its height. Most video shown on the internet uses a 16:9 aspect ratio, which means that for every pixel in the Y, there are roughly 1.77 pixels in the X (where 1.77 ~= 16/9). As an example, 1080p video with an aspect ratio of 16:9 would have an X resolution of 1920, however 1080p video with an aspect ratio of 4:3 would have an X resolution of 1440.

// Write a function that accepts arbitrary X and Y resolutions and converts them into resolutions with a 16:9 aspect ratio that maintain equal height. Round your answers up to the nearest integer.

function aspectRatio(x, y) {
  const xConverted = Math.ceil((y * 16) / 9);
  return [xConverted, y];
}

// You are given a program squaresOnly that accepts an array of natural numbers up to and including 100 (and including 0) of length >= 1, array, and returns a new array containing only square numbers that have appeared in the input array.

// Refactor the solution to use as few characters as possible. There is a maximum character limit of 127. Here are a few hints:

//     There are a lot of handy built-in Array methods in Javascript that you may have never heard of even after completing a basic course in Javascript (e.g. those provided by Codecademy) - well, at least I haven't heard of until quite recently. You may also want to research any new built-in methods offered by ES6, the newest specification of Javascript at the time of writing.
//     Don't you think the array parameter is a bit wordy? ;)
function squaresOnly(arr) {
  return arr.filter((e) => Math.sqrt(e) % 1 === 0);
}

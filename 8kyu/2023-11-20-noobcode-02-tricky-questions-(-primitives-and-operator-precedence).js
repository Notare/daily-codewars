// 1 < 2 < 3 === true right? but could

// 3 < 2 < 1 === true too??

// Here's your puzzle: Write a function greaterThanLessThan that takes three arguments, a, b, and c, and returns a boolean (true or false), such that:

// greaterThanLessThan(1, 2 3) === true

// and

// greaterThanLessThan(3, 2 1) === true

// But also

// graterThanLessThan(-3, -2, -1) == false

// with more examples on the expected behavior in the test cases.
// Hints

//     Arguments do not necessarily have to be in strict ascending or descending order, as indicated by the example test cases.

// Check out the included test cases - not all arguments are going to return true! It's up to you to figure out which ones do and which ones don't.

//     This challenge is a LOT easier than it might seem at first. Don't focus too much on building functions - just pay attention to precedence.

// Best of luck!

function greaterThanLessThan(a, b, c) {
  return a < b < c;
}

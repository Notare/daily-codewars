// There are pillars near the road. The distance between the pillars is the same and the width of the pillars is the same. Your function accepts three arguments:

//     number of pillars (â‰¥ 1);
//     distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);
//     width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).

// Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar).

function pillars(num_pill, dist, width) {
  return num_pill > 1
    ? (num_pill - 1) * dist * 100 + (num_pill - 2) * width
    : 0;
}

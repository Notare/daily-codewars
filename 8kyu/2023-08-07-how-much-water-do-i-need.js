// My washing machine uses water amount of water to wash load (in JavaScript and Python) or max_load (in Ruby) amount of clothes. You are given a clothes amount of clothes to wash. For each single item of clothes above the load, the washing machine will use 10% more water (multiplicative) to clean.

// For example, if the load is 10, the amount of water it requires is 5 and the amount of clothes to wash is 14, then you need 5 * 1.1 ^ (14 - 10) amount of water.

// Write a function howMuchWater (JS)/how_much_water (Python and Ruby) to work out how much water is needed if you have a clothes amount of clothes. The function will accept 3 arguments: - water, load (or max_loadin Ruby) and clothes.

// My washing machine is an old model that can only handle double the amount of load (or max_load). If the amount of clothes is more than 2 times the standard amount of load (max_load), return 'Too much clothes'. The washing machine also cannot handle any amount of clothes less than load (max_load). If that is the case, return 'Not enough clothes'.

// The answer should be rounded to the nearest 2 decimal places.
function howMuchWater(water, load, clothes) {
  if (clothes > load * 2) {
    return "Too much clothes";
  }

  if (clothes < load) {
    return "Not enough clothes";
  }

  return +(water * 1.1 ** (clothes - load)).toFixed(2);
}

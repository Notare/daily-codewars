// You are creating a text-based terminal version of your favorite board game. In the board game, each turn has six steps that must happen in this order: roll the dice, move, combat, get coins, buy more health, and print status.

// You are using a library (Game.Logic in C#) that already has the functions below. Create a function named doTurn/DoTurn/do_turn that calls the functions in the proper order as described in the paragraph above.

// - combat
// - buyHealth
// - getCoins
// - printStatus
// - rollDice
// - move

function doTurn() {
  rollDice();
  move();
  combat();
  getCoins();
  buyHealth();
  printStatus();
}

// Escape the room

// You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).

var rooms = {
  room1: {
    name: "",
    description: "",
    completed: "",
  },
  room2: {
    name: "",
    description: "",
    completed: "",
  },
  room3: {
    name: "",
    description: "",
    completed: "",
  },
};

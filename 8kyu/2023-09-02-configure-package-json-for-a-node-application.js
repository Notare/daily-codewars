// Nodejs package.json

// Node applications require a file named package.json on the root of the project.

// You can create this file manually or have the command npm init to assist you in this process.

// The fields name and version are mandatory. But there a lot of other fields that you can include:

// for a documentation on all fields see https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json

//     name: must be lowercase and url friendly
//     version: must include major, minor and patch version
//     description: can contain a description of your project
//     main: the entry point of your application (when running node without args)
//     scripts: a set of commands that can be executed with npm run <cmd>
//     keywords: an array of strings containing keywords that describe your application
//     bugs: an object with the url and/or email to contact about bugs
//     license: a valid SPDX license or UNLICENSED (proprietary) or SEE LICENSE IN <filename>
//     author: the name, email and url in a single string or an object with these three properties
//     contributors: an array of items that follow the same rules as author
//     repository: an object with type (e.g. git) and url (e.g. git url)
//     private: true|false; if true the repository field can be omitted without any warnings
//     preferGlobal: true|false; if your application is preferred to be installed globally
//     engines: object listing engines and versions used by your application
//     os: array of strings with supported OS
//     cpu: array of strings with supported CPU
//     dependencies: run-time dependencies of your application, things that will run in production
//     devDependencies: compile-time dependencies of your application, things that should not be in production

// The dependencies is an object with the name of modules as keys and the values are the versions. For example to require babel in your application you would have these entries:

// {
//   "babel-core": "^6.0.0",
//   "babel-polyfill": "^6.0.0",
//   "babel-preset-es2015": "^6.0.0",
//   "babel-preset-stage-0": "^6.0.0"
// }

// Your task

// Create a package.json configuration and assign it to the configuration constant so it can be tested.

// To pass the kata you need only the least that a real package file would require.
// Notes

//     the kata version validation doesn't handle all cases and isn't 100% accurate, so don't try to be too fancy, stick to with the simple
//     to simplify the license validation this kata only allows the following
//         ISC
//         MIT
//         UNLICENSED
//         SEE LICENSE IN filename
const configuration = {
  name: "your-pack-name",
  description: "",
  version: "1.0.0",
};
// Hint: try creating with `npm init` command

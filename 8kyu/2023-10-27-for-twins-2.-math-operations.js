// A magician in the subway showed you a trick, he put an ice brick in a bottle to impress you. The brick's length and width are equal, forming a square; its height may be different. Just for fun and also to impress the magician and people around, you decided to calculate the brick's volume. Write a function iceBrickVolume that will accept these parameters:

//     radius - bottle's radius (always > 0);
//     bottleLength - total bottle length (always > 0);
//     rimLength - length from bottle top to brick (always < bottleLength);

// And return volume of ice brick that magician managed to put into a bottle.

// illustration
// Note:

// All inputs are integers. Assume no irregularities to the cuboid brick. You may assume the bottle is shaped like a cylinder. The brick cannot fit inside the rim. The ice brick placed into the bottle is the largest possible cuboid that could actually fit inside the inner volume.
// Example 1:

// radius = 1
// bottle_length = 10
// rim_length = 2

// volume = 16

// Example 2:

// radius = 5
// bottle_length = 30
// rim_length = 7

// volume = 1150
const iceBrickVolume = (r, x, y) => 2 * r * r * (x - y);

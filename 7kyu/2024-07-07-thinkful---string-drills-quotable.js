// This function should take two string parameters: a person's name (name) and a quote of theirs (quote), and return a string attributing the quote to the person in the following format:

// '[name] said: "[quote]"'

// For example, if name is 'Grae' and 'quote' is 'Practice makes perfect' then your function should return the string

// 'Grae said: "Practice makes perfect"'

// Unfortunately, something is wrong with the instructions in the function body. Your job is to fix it so the function returns correctly formatted quotes.

// Click the "Train" button to get started, and be careful with your quotation marks.
function quotable(name, quote) {
  return `${name} said: "${quote}"`;
}

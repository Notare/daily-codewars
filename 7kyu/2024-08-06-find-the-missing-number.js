// This question is a variation on the Arithmetic Progression kata

// The following was a question that I received during a technical interview for an entry level software developer position. I thought I'd post it here so that everyone could give it a go:

// You are given an unsorted array containing all the integers from 0 to 100 inclusively. However, one number is missing. Write a function to find and return this number. What are the time and space complexities of your solution?
function missingNo(nums) {
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (!nums.includes(i)) {
      return i;
    }
  }
}

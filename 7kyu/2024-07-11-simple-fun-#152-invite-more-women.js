// Task

// King Arthur and his knights are having a New Years party. Last year Lancelot was jealous of Arthur, because Arthur had a date and Lancelot did not, and they started a duel.

// To prevent this from happening again, Arthur wants to make sure that there are at least as many women as men at this year's party. He gave you a list of integers of all the party goers.

// Arthur needs you to return true if he needs to invite more women or false if he is all set.
// Input/Output

//     [input] integer array L ($a in PHP)

// An array (guaranteed non-associative in PHP) representing the genders of the attendees, where -1 represents women and 1 represents men.

// 2 <= L.length <= 50

//     [output] a boolean value

//     true if Arthur need to invite more women, false otherwise.
function inviteMoreWomen(list) {
  let numOfWomen = 0;
  let numOfMen = 0;

  list.forEach((person) => {
    if (person < 0) {
      numOfWomen++;
    } else {
      numOfMen++;
    }
  });

  return numOfWomen < numOfMen;
}

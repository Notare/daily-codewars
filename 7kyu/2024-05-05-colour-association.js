// Colour plays an important role in our lifes. Most of us like this colour better then another. User experience specialists believe that certain colours have certain psychological meanings for us.

// You are given a 2D array, composed of a colour and its 'common' association in each array element. The function you will write needs to return the colour as 'key' and association as its 'value'.

// For example:

// var array = [["white", "goodness"], ...] //returns [{white: 'goodness'}, ...]
function colourAssociation(array) {
  return array.map(([key, value]) => ({ [key]: value }));
}

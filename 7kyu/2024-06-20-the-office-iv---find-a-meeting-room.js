// Your job at E-Corp is both boring and difficult. It isn't made any easier by the fact that everyone constantly wants to have a meeting with you, and that the meeting rooms are always taken!

// In this kata, you will be given an array. Each value represents a meeting room. Your job? Find the first empty one and return its index (N.B. There may be more than one empty room in some test cases).

// 'X' --> busy
// 'O' --> empty

// If all rooms are busy, return "None available!"
function meeting(x) {
  const roomAvailable = x.findIndex((room) => room === "O");
  return roomAvailable !== -1 ? roomAvailable : "None available!";
}

// Create a Vector class with x and a y attributes that represent component magnitudes in the x and y directions.

// Your vectors should handle vector additon with an .add() method that takes a second vector as an argument and returns a new vector equal to the sum of the vector you call .add() on and the vector you pass in.

// For example:

// >>> a = Vector(3, 4)
// >>> a.x
// 3
// >>> a.y
// 4
// >>> b = Vector(1, 2)
// >>> c = a.add(b)
// >>> c.x
// 4
// >>> c.y
// 6

// Adding vectors when you have their components is easy: just add the two x components together and the two y components together to get the x and y components for the vector sum.
class Vector {
  constructor(x, y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }

  add(vec) {
    return new Vector(this.x + vec.x, this.y + vec.y);
  }
}

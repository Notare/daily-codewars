// Strings, strings, strings (Easy)
// Background

// Oh no, there were some problems with your computer and now you cannot convert any data type to strings!
// Task

// The toString() method has been disabled for booleans, numbers, arrays and objects. Your goal is to retrive toString() for the following data types.
// I. Booleans

// For booleans:

//     true should be converted to "true"
//     false should be converted to "false"

// II. Numbers

// For numbers, conversion should be as follows:

// // e.g.
// (3).toString() === "3"
// (3.14).toString() === "3.14"
// (-78).toString() === "-78"
// Math.PI.toString() === "3.141592653589793"

// III. Arrays

// For the purposes of this Kata, you will only be expected to convert arrays with numbers only into strings. However, on top of fixing it, we would also like to improve it as well. We would like to keep the square brackets ([]) around the "stringified" array as it would be seen in Javascript code. For example:

// // e.g.
// [].toString() === "[]"
// [1].toString() === "[1]"
// [2,4,8,17].toString() === "[2, 4, 8, 17]"
// [Math.PI, Math.E].toString() === "[3.141592653589793,2.718281828459045]"

// As you may have noticed in the examples above, when the array has more than one element, some of the strings have spaces as well as commas separating each item but some strings do not. For the purposes of this Kata whether there are whitespaces or not does not matter for stringified arrays - before conducting the tests your input is stripped of all whitespace.
// Final Note - IMPORTANT

// Your recovered toString() methods should only return the stringified version of the input - it should NOT alter the original value. Test cases have been created to confirm this.
String.prototype.toString = function () {
  return `${this}`;
};
